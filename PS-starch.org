* Draw and label the 4 main organs of a plant
* What two functions does the roots have ?
** Take water and minerals from the soil/Anchor the plant in soil
* Explain why roots have roots hair?
** greatly increase the surface area available for the uptake of nutrients from the soil.
* -What are the leaves attached to ? -And what does it do ?
** *Stem*: Stem transports water and food
* What does the leaves do?
** Produce food (photosynthesis)
* What does the soil contain that the plant needs? (name all 4 main things)
** *Water* and *minerals*: K, N and P
* What is the formula for photosynthesis?
** 6 CO2 + 6 H2O	->	 C6 H12O6 + 6 O2  / Carbon dioxide + water ->	  glucose + oxygen
* What are xylem and phloem vessels ?
** *Xylem* – vessel that transports minerals and water from the roots to the leaves / *Phloem* – vessel that transports nutrients around the plant.
* What makes leaves green?
** Chlorophyll
* What is the name of the part of the plant’s cell where photosynthesis occur?
** Chloroplast
* What type of energy is needed for photosynthesis to occur?
** Light
* Where does the plant store its food? And what is it stored as?
** Fruit/root/seed / Starch
* How to destarch a plant?
** Put it in the dark
* How can you prove plants produce O2? Design an experiment.
* How can you prove plants need light to photosynthesize? 
* How can you prove plants need CO2 to photosynthesize? 
* Can roots photosynthesize? Explain your answers?R
