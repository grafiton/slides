<h2 id="sec-5">Designing a survey</h2>
<p>
Imagine that the government wishes to spend more money on schools it may need to raise more money through taxes to achieves this.
It may want to carry out a survey to fidn out what people think of that idea.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<section id="slide-sec-6">
<h2 id="sec-6">In group, find out what is the best question for this survey</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do you think you pay too much tax?</li>
<li>Do you think our schools are good?</li>
<li>Would you be prepared to pay more tax if the money was spent on improving schools?</li>
<li>Do you think the government spends too much money on offices for politicians and not enough on new schools?</li>

<h2 id="sec-7">Rules to observe to produce meaningfull and precise sets of data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
</div></section>
<section id="slide-sec-7-1">
<h3 id="sec-7-1">1. Make it clear what is it you are trying to find out</h3>
<p>
For example. 'Excuse me. I am conducting a survey to find out if people would like to see new traffic lights at these crossroads. Please would you help me by answering a few simple questions?'
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-7-2">
<h3 id="sec-7-2">2. Make the questions simple and give choice of answer</h3>
<p>
For example, a television company wishes to know how much its coverage of the athletics events in the Beijing Olympics was watched.
An example of a bad question would be:<br  />
Did you watch much of the Olympics on TV?
A better question might be:<br  />
The Beijing Olympics were shown on TV. How many hours did you watch of the athletics events?<br  />
<b>a)</b> none <b>b)</b> 1-5 hours <b>c)</b> 6-10 hours <b>d)</b> 11-15 hours <b>e)</b> 16-20 hours
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-7-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-3">3. Make your question ask for the other person's opinion. Do not make it clear what your opinion is (this would be called <i>biased</i> question or a <i>leading</i> question).</h3>
<p>
A bad example would be: Fishing is a very cruel pastime. Do you agree?<br  />
A better question might be: Do you think that fishing is a cruel pastime?<br  />
<b>a)</b> strongly agre <b>b)</b> agree <b>c)</b> neutral <b>d)</b> disagree <b>e)</b> strongly disagree
