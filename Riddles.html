A claustrophobic person gets on a train. The train enters a tunnel just as it is leaving the station.

Where is the best place for him to sit?
</p>

<section id="slide-sec-6">
<h2 id="sec-6">Answer:</h2>
<p>
In the back. The train will be accelerating so it will be going faster when the back of the train enters the tunnel so a person in the back will spend less time in the tunnel.

What's the angle between minute hand and hour hand at a quarter past three?
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-12">
<h2 id="sec-12">Answer:</h2>
<p>
7.5 degrees.
</p>

<p>
The minute hand is pointing directly at the '3'. The hour hand is 1/4 of the way between the '3' and '4'. Since there are 12 numbers the angle between each number is 30 degrees. So the angle between the hands are 30 degrees * 1/4 = 7.5 degrees.

There are two ropes that both take exactly 1 hour to burn from end to end. You are unable to cut the rope. How can you burn the two ropes in a total of 45 minutes?
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-14">
<h2 id="sec-14">Answer:</h2>
<p>
Start one of the ropes on fire from both ends and the other one from one end. After a half an hour one rope will be completely burnt and the other will be half burnt. At this point you light the final rope from the unlit side and it will take 15 minutes for the remaining half of the rope to burn, for a total of 45 minutes.
