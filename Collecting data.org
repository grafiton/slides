* Rules to observe to produce meaningfull and precise sets of data
** 1. Make it clear what is it you are trying to find out
For example. 'Excuse me. I am conducting a survey to find out if people would like to see new traffic lights at these crossroads. Please would you help me by answering a few simple questions?'
** 2. Make the questions simple and give choice of answer
For example, a television company wishes to know how much its coverage of the athletics events in the Beijing Olympics was watched.
An example of a bad question would be:\\
Did you watch much of the Olympics on TV?
A better question might be:\\
The Beijing Olympics were shown on TV. How many hours did you watch of the athletics events?\\
*a)* none *b)* 1-5 hours *c)* 6-10 hours *d)* 11-15 hours *e)* 16-20 hours
** 3. Make your question ask for the other person's opinion. Do not make it clear what your opinion is (this would be called /biased/ question or a /leading/ question).
A bad example would be: Fishing is a very cruel pastime. Do you agree?\\
A better question might be: Do you think that fishing is a cruel pastime?\\
*a)* strongly agre *b)* agree *c)* neutral *d)* disagree *e)* strongly disagree
** 4. Do not ask sensitive or embarrassing questions.
