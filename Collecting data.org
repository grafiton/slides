Examples

* Survey
Survey are needed by companies and organisations for a number of reasons.
Survey should be 
- meaningful
- straight to the point
* Designing a survey
Imagine that the government wishes to spend more money on schools it may need to raise more money through taxes to achieves this.
It may want to carry out a survey to fidn out what people think of that idea.
* In group, find out what is the best question for this survey
1. Do you think you pay too much tax?
2. Do you think our schools are good?
3. Would you be prepared to pay more tax if the money was spent on improving schools?
4. Do you think the government spends too much money on offices for politicians and not enough on new schools?
# A. Do you think you pay too much tax?
# B. Do you think our schools are good?
# C. Would you be prepared to pay more tax if the money was spent on improving schools?
# D. Do you think the government spends too much money on offices for politicians and not enough on new schools?
* Rules to observe to produce meaningfull and precise sets of data
** 1. Make it clear what is it you are trying to find out
For example. 'Excuse me. I am conducting a survey to find out if people would like to see new traffic lights at these crossroads. Please would you help me by answering a few simple questions?'
** 2. Make the questions simple and give choice of answer
For example, a television company wishes to know how much its coverage of the athletics events in the Beijing Olympics was watched.
An example of a bad question would be:\\
Did you watch much of the Olympics on TV?
A better question might be:\\
The Beijing Olympics were shown on TV. How many hours did you watch of the athletics events?\\
*a)* none *b)* 1-5 hours *c)* 6-10 hours *d)* 11-15 hours *e)* 16-20 hours
** 3. Make your question ask for the other person's opinion. Do not make it clear what your opinion is (this would be called /biased/ question or a /leading/ question).
A bad example would be: Fishing is a very cruel pastime. Do you agree?\\
A better question might be: Do you think that fishing is a cruel pastime?\\
*a)* strongly agre *b)* agree *c)* neutral *d)* disagree *e)* strongly disagree
** 4. Do not ask sensitive or embarrassing questions.
