<h2 id="orgheadline34">Math Riddles #19 - Find Out Who Survives Riddle</h2>
<p>
100 people are standing in a circle. The person standing at number 1 is having a sword. He kills the person next to him with the sword and then gives the sword to the third person. This process is carried out till there is just one person left.
Can you find out who survives?

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline35">
<h2 id="orgheadline35">Solution:</h2>
<p>
The person on 73rd number will survive.
Explanation:
Till the number is the power of 2, the last person to survive will be the one who started it. But since the number here is not the power of 2, we will take the greatest power of 2 that is less than the number which is 64. 
100 - 64 = 36
36 people are killed as 2, 4, 6, &#x2026;, 72. Thus the sword will now be given to the 73rd person. Now he is the first person to start in the remaining 64 people. Thus he will be the one to survive.

<p>
I can prove why 1 = 2
</p>

<p>
Step1. Lets say y = x<br  />
Step2. Multiply through by x xy = x2<br  />
Step3. Subtract y2 from each side xy - y2 = x2 - y2<br  />
Step4. Factor each side y(x-y) = (x+y)(x-y)<br  />
Step5. Divide both sides by (x-y) y = x+y<br  />
Step6. Divide both sides by y y/y = x/y + y/y<br  />
Step7. And so&#x2026; 1 = x/y + 1<br  />
Step8. Since x=y, x/y = 1 1 = 1 + 1<br  />
Step9. And so&#x2026; 1 = 2<br  />

How is this possible ? 
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline47">
<h2 id="orgheadline47">Solution:</h2>
<p>
Step 5 is invalid, because we are dividing by (x-y), and since x=y, we are thus dividing by 0. This is an invalid mathematical operation (division by 0), and so by not following basic mathematical rules

<h2 id="orgheadline58">Math Riddles #31 - Live Or Die Probability Puzzle</h2>
<p>
Hussey has been caught stealing goats, and is brought into court for justice. 
The judge is his ex-wife Amy Hussey, who wants to show him some sympathy, but the law clearly calls for two shots to be taken at Hussey from close range. 
To make things a little better for Hussey, Amy Hussey tells him she will place two bullets into a six-chambered revolver in successive order. 
She will spin the chamber, close it, and take one shot. 
If Hussey is still alive, she will then either take another shot, or spin the chamber again before shooting.
Hussey is a bit incredulous that his own ex-wife would carry out the punishment, and a bit sad that she was always such a rule follower. 
He steels himself as Amy Hussey loads the chambers, spins the revolver, and pulls the trigger. Whew! It was blank. Then Amy Hussey asks, 'Do you want me to pull the trigger again, or should I spin the chamber a second time before pulling the trigger?'
What should Hussey choose? 
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline59">
<h2 id="orgheadline59">Solution:</h2>
<p>
Hussey should have Amy Hussey pull the trigger again without spinning.
We know that the first chamber Amy Hussey fired was one of the four empty chambers. Since the bullets were placed in consecutive order, one of the empty chambers is followed by a bullet, and the other three empty chambers are followed by another empty chamber. So if Hussey has Amy Hussey pull the trigger again, the probability that a bullet will be fired is 1/4.
If Amy Hussey spins the chamber again, the probability that she shoots Hussey would be 2/6, or 1/3, since there are two possible bullets that would be in firing position out of the six possible chambers that would be in position.
