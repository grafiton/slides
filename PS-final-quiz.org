* What are the products of photosynthesis?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none grow none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Carbon dioxide and water
- Glucose and oxygen
- Lactic acid

* What colour is chlorophyll?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none grow)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Black
- Blue
- Green

* Where does photosynthesis take place?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- In the chloroplasts
- In the cell wall
- In the nucleus

* What are the reactants of photosynthesis?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Carbon dioxide and water
- Carbon dioxide and oxygen
- Glucose and oxygen

* When do plants respire?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none grow none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- During the day only
- During the day and night
- During the night only

* When do plants photosynthesise?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none grow)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- During the day and night
- During the night only
- During the day only

* What are the cells near the top of leaves called?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Palisade cells
- Root hair cells
- Red blood cells

* What does xylem carry?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Water
- Blood
- Carbohydrates

* What do stomata do?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none grow)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Stop carbon dioxide diffusing into leaves
- Allow oxygen to diffuse into leaves
- Allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into leaves

* How are root hair cells adapted?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Huge surface area
- Lots of chloroplasts
- Have no cell wall

* Which gas is needed for photosynthesis?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none grow none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- oxygen
- carbon dioxide
- hydrogen

* What type of energy is needed for photosynthesis to happen?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- light
- heat
- sound

* What is produced as a waste by-product from photosynthesis?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow none none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- oxygen
- glucose
- carbon dioxide

* The green substance needed to absorb energy for photosynthesis is:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none grow)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- carotene
- melanin
- chlorophyll

* Tomatoes in a greenhouse grow faster if the carbon dioxide concentration is increased. This shows that:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none grow none)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Temperature must have been a limiting factor.
- Carbon dioxide concentration must have been a limiting factor.
- Light intensity must have been a limiting factor.

* Why do plants need nitrate ions?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none grow)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- To make fatty acids for proteins.
- To make proteins that are then used to form fatty acids.
- To make amino acids that are then used to make proteins.

* A plant with yellow leaves could be growing in soil deficient in:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none grow)  :frag_idx (1 2 3)
- Magnesium ions.
- Nitrate ions.
- Chlorophyll.
