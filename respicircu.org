* Which organ system helps us breathe?
Gas exchange system / Circulatory system / Nervous system
** Which organ system helps us breathe?
*Gas exchange system* / Circulatory system / Nervous system
* What does the trachea divide into?

* Cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood and:
blood vessels / lungs / muscles

*lungs* / heart / blood vessels
* Stroke volume is the volume, per heart beat, of:
carbon dioxide removed / blood pumped / air breathed
** Stroke volume is the volume, per heart beat, of:
carbon dioxide removed / *blood pumped* / air breathed
* Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart:
in one beat / during exercise / in one minute
** Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart:
*in one beat* / during exercise / in one minute

*oxygen* / carbon dioxide / water
* Blood pressure is the force of blood:
against artery walls / in the heart / through the lungs
** Blood pressure is the force of blood:
*against artery walls* / in the heart / through the lungs
