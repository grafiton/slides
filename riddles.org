* Math Riddles #18 - Find Out Who Survives Riddle 
100 people are standing in a circle. The person standing at number 1 is having a sword. He kills the person next to him with the sword and then gives the sword to the third person. This process is carried out till there is just one person left.
Can you find out who survives? 
* Solution:
The person on 73rd number will survive.
Explanation:
Till the number is the power of 2, the last person to survive will be the one who started it. But since the number here is not the power of 2, we will take the greatest power of 2 that is less than the number which is 64. 
100 - 64 = 36
36 people are killed as 2, 4, 6, ..., 72. Thus the sword will now be given to the 73rd person. Now he is the first person to start in the remaining 64 people. Thus he will be the one to survive.
* Math Riddles #19 - Popular Tricky Picture Death Riddle 
AS you can see the picture, all you have to do is analyze it and tell who all from the pictured people will die if the person at E pushes the round object to the slide on the slope. Keep in mind all the physics and the terrain while you analyze the things.

* Math Riddles #21 - Popular Math Problem 
Evaluate 100^2 - 99^2 + 98^2 - 97^2 + 96^2 - 95^2 + ... + 2^2 - 1^2 =? 
* Solution:
*5050*\\

Explanation:\\
You must have noticed that 50 pairs of n^2 – (n-1) ^2 exist.
n^2 – (n-1)^2 = n + (n – 1)

In such case, we may as well write 100^2 - 99^2 + 98^2 - 97^2 + 96^2 - 95^2 + ... + 2^2 - 1^2 as 100 + 99 + 98+ ... + 2 + 1 = (100 x 101)/2 = 5050
* Math Riddles #22 - Maths Logical Problem 
The digits 0-9(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) can be rearranged into 3628800 distinct 10 digits numbers.

How many of these numbers are prime ? 
* Solution:
None

The sum of numbers from 0-9(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) is 45 and therefore can be divisible by 3 and 9.
* Math Riddles #23 - Maths Trick Riddle 
I know a number which when multiplied by multiple of 9 i.e 9 18 27 36 45 ... the output consist of number containing only one digit.

Can you identify the number ? 
* Solution:
12345679\\

12345679 × 9 = 111111111 (only 1s)\\
12345679 × 18 = 222222222 (only 2s)\\
12345679 × 27 = 333333333 (only 3s)\\
12345679 × 36 = 444444444 (only 4s)\\
12345679 × 45 = 555555555 (only 5s)
* Math Riddles #24 - Maths Magic Riddle 
I can prove why 1 = 2

Step1. Lets say y = x\\
Step2. Multiply through by x xy = x2\\
Step3. Subtract y2 from each side xy - y2 = x2 - y2\\
Step4. Factor each side y(x-y) = (x+y)(x-y)\\
Step5. Divide both sides by (x-y) y = x+y\\
Step6. Divide both sides by y y/y = x/y + y/y\\
Step7. And so... 1 = x/y + 1\\
Step8. Since x=y, x/y = 1 1 = 1 + 1\\
Step9. And so... 1 = 2\\

How is this possible ? 
* Solution:
Step 5 is invalid, because we are dividing by (x-y), and since x=y, we are thus dividing by 0. This is an invalid mathematical operation (division by 0), and so by not following basic mathematical rules
